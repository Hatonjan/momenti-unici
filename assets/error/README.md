## Momenti Unici

**Momenti Unici** is a luxury jewelry website created to evoke a luxury jewelry store. More than a storefront, itâ€™s a narrative-driven interface that invites users into a world of emotional storytelling and symbolic design.

### Project Overview

This project started as a capstone project for the Meta HTML and CSS In Depth certification and I transformed into a piece for my portfolio, blending luxury branding, responsive design, and interactive elements. Inspired by literary symbolism and the emotional weight of handcrafted jewelry, Momenti Unici showcases:

- A modular logo system designed for elegance and scalability
- Poetic product captions and alt text for accessibility and emotional lift
- A hidden easter egg gallery inspired by Tolkienâ€™s Nine Rings
- Custom cursor interactions and viewport-triggered animations
- Responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop experiences

---

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **Responsive design** with fluid typography and scalable layout
- **InkScape** for custom SVG logo and iconography
- **GIMP** for image editing and cursor design
- **Google Fonts** (Charm, Playfair Display) for typographic tone

---

###  Notable Features

- **ðŸ”¥Flame Cursor Reveal**: A custom flame cursor activates hidden text, adding mystery and interactivity.
- **Nine Rings Gallery**: A secret grid of symbolic rings, each with its own environment and poetic caption.
- **Dark Mode Optimization**: Logo and color palette adapt seamlessly for accessibility and mood.
- **Emotionally Resonant Copywriting**: Every phrase is crafted to evoke intimacy, aspiration, and mythic depth.
