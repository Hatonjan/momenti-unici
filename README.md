### Project Overview

This project started as a capstone project for the Meta HTML and CSS In Depth certification and I transformed into a piece for my portfolio, blending luxury branding, responsive design, and interactive elements. Inspired by the emotional weight of handcrafted jewelry, Momenti Unici showcases:

- A modular logo system designed for elegance and scalability
- Poetic product captions and alt text for accessibility and emotional lift
- A hidden easter egg gallery inspired by Tolkienâ€™s Nine Rings <!-- Click on the Â© at the bottom -->
- Responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop experiences

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **Responsive design** with fluid typography and scalable layout
- **Git** for version control
- **InkScape** for custom SVG logo
- **GIMP** for image editing and cursor design
- **Google Fonts** (Sedan SC, Italianno, and EB Garamond) for typographic tone

###  Notable Features
